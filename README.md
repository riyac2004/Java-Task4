# Java-Task4
Task 4 Calculator

**Project Description**
This project is a console-based Simple Calculator application developed using the Java programming language. The main objective of this project is to perform basic arithmetic operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division by applying core Java concepts including methods, exception handling, switch-case control structure, and pass-by-value.
The calculator accepts two numeric inputs from the user along with an arithmetic operator. Based on the operator entered, the corresponding method is invoked to perform the calculation. Each arithmetic operation is implemented using a separate static method, ensuring modularity and reusability of code.
To make the application robust and user-friendly, exception handling is implemented using try, catch, and finally blocks. The program safely handles runtime errors such as division by zero and invalid user input, preventing abnormal program termination.
Java follows the pass-by-value mechanism, where copies of actual parameters are passed to methods. This project demonstrates pass-by-value clearly, as the original values of the numbers remain unchanged while calculations are performed inside methods.
Overall, this project helps beginners understand structured programming, error handling, and method invocation in Java, making it suitable for academic learning and foundational Java practice.

**Objectives of the Project**
-> To perform basic arithmetic calculations using Java.
-> To understand and implement methods.
